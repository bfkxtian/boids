# Boids
## A bird-like simulation, written in JavaScript/Canvas

Craig Reynolds' Boids simulates the flocking behaviour of birds and can provide a fun programming excercise.
If you want to see a running example, head over to https://benchristian.xyz/posts/boids, or alternatively create a simple webpage with a canvas element (height, width of 800px).

There are some small issues that I may get around to fixing given interest:
- Game window is hardcoded and does not support resizing.
- Performance is an issue on low-end hardware, this could be addressed by reducing number of boids in the simulation (maybe through hardware survey?).

Source code by me, Benjamin Christian. Do with it what you wish :)
